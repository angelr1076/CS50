            <h2>History:</h2>
            <p>Thousands of years ago, Voltron was created through a combination of science and magic.
                However,
                the witch Haggar cast a spell that split Voltron into five robotic lions, removing its sentience in the
                process. Each lion embodies an element: water (Blue Lion), land (Yellow Lion), fire (Red Lion), sky
                (Black Lion), and forest (Green Lion). Voltron defends the universe with the five Paladins piloting it.
            </p>

            <p>In 1999, the planet of Arus is subdued and enslaved by the Drule Empire. One day, five earthborn space
                explorers approached Planet Arus which was under attack by Zarkon's forces. The crew wanted to help, but
                they were too late. As they surveyed the ruins, they are picked up by one of Zarkon's ships and
                arrested.</p>

            <p>The group of five were about to be put in an arena where they would have to fight to the death, but using
                each of their individual strengths, the explorers managed to break out of their cells and escape. The
                team then escaped Galraâ€™s ship via a slave ship which eventually gets damaged, and they soon crashed on
                the planet Alrus near the Castle of Lions.</p>

            <p>The leader of the five, Keith Hogane, quickly recounted the legend of how the formidable heroic robot
                known as Voltron was defeated and considered that they may have found where Voltron was sleeping all
                along. After gathering together, the team did some recon and they decided to go where the castle was
                supposedly located in the mountains. After dealing with space mice and cave people, they eventually came
                across the castle, and while exploring it they met an old man named Coran who was the castle diplomat.
                Coran explained what truly happened to Voltron and the group met another member of the castle, Princess
                Allura.</p>

            <p>In order to stop the Galra Empire, Coran and Allura agreed with the second-in-command, Sven Holgersson,
                and the others to reform the universe defending team with Voltron, but before they could, Keith asked
                where the lions were and Coran explained their location to the team. With that, the five explorers set
                out in order to find the five lions. The new team was formed as they were given new equipment to find
                the lions, and eventually after some time, they find the lions and defeat a robeast, a robot constructed
                by the Galra Empire, through forming Voltron for the first time.</p>

            <p>After the robeast is defeated, they dedicated themselves to becoming the new defenders of the universe,
                the Voltron Force. The five pilots consisted of Keith Kogane, Sven Holgersson, the hot-headed ace flier
                Lance McClain, the muscle Tsuyoshi "Hunk" Garrett, and the young genius Darrell "Pidge" Stoker. After
                Sven's death/incapacitation (depending on the dub), he is replaced by the Altean Princess, Allura.</p>
