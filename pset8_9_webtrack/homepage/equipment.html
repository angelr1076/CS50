            <h3>Armament</h3>
            <p>Blazing Sword: Voltron’s signature weapon. The Blazing Sword is formed when the Red Lion head and
                Green
                Lion
                head
                joining together. This weapon is capable of slaying extremely large Robeasts and other giant robots
                with
                ease. Like a
                mirror, it can be used to deflect beam attacks back at its opponent. In addition, it can be used to
                store
                solar energy
                and once enough is collected, Voltron can direct the energy to its opponent, paralyzing it so it can
                go
                in
                for the kill.
                With the sword, it can unleash the Starfire attack, a move capable of cutting enemies into pieces
                and
                also
                create a
                tornado as well.</p>
            <p>Electro-Saber: A secondary bladed weapon which Voltron can throw at its opponents or use to cut
                energy
                attacks.</p>
            <p>Lion Saber: A secondary sword weapon that is not as strong as the Burning Sword.</p>
            <p>Spinning Laser Blades: Voltron throws bladed disks at its opponent which can explode on contact.
                Lion Lariat: A whip-like weapon that can be used for stringing up foes.
                Neutron Needles: When caught in sticky situations, Voltron can fire needles from part of its head to
                blind
                the enemy.</p>
            <p>Eye Beams: Voltron can fire eye beams at its opponent to distract or stun them momentarily.</p>
            <p>Ice Ray: In addition to the eye beams, Voltron can also fire an ice ray from a part of its head,
                freezing
                its opponents.</p>
            <p>Proton/Sting Ray Missiles: Voltron can fire missiles from the blue and yellow lion heads situated at
                its
                feet.</p>
            <p>Electroblasters: From the mouths of the green and red lion, Voltron can fire beams of electricity at
                its
                opponent.</p>
            <p>Lion Torches & Solar Wind: From the mouths of the lions, Voltron is capable of unleashing a barrage
                of
                fire
                and solar
                wind at its enemies.</p>
            <p>Electro-Force Cross: From its chest, it can fire a cross-shaped beam at its opponents, shocking
                them.
                Lion Hands & Feet: Due to Voltron’s hands and feet being the heads of the lions, it can use them to
                grab
                and
                lift
                enemies into the air or bite them to deal damage.</p>
            <p>Lion Head Attack: The heads of the 4 lions that make up Voltron's limbs can launch at once, smashing
                through
                their
                target at the same time.</p>
            <p>Argon Forcefield: Voltron can create an electrified force field around itself for protection.</p>
